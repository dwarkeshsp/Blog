In response to Mark Andreessen arguing that many people will be better off in virtual reality than real life, Ross Douthat writes:

Whereas while the age of the internet has clearly expanded the range of available experiences, for core experiences democratization sometimes seems like it’s in danger of going into reverse, with experiences in reality, from the museum to the ballpark to the classroom, becoming the high-cost “premium” experience, while a mediocre virtual equivalent is offered the masses and the proles.

Ross gives the examples of online dating vs traditional courtship and video games vs sports. But it's unclear to me how these modern options have made their predecessors higher cost. An alternative has been presented

To the extent that people are choosing what seem to be less satisfying internet mediated alternatives, I respond: actions speak louder that words. 

To which my response is simply - actions speak louder that words.

I am not dissing people by saying that they don't really care to visit grand cathedrals and great festivals.

In which case might not a lot of real-world “building” just be a reality-privileged distraction from the more important goal, the more socially-just and democratic goal, of building every man and woman a Matrix of their own?

This is meant to be a reductio ad absurdum. Surely, Andreeson would not sugest that the

Even if computing continues to be a growing industry, it may get saturated at even faster pace by great talent from across the world. Great sections of Youtube have been dedicated to helping self-motivated kids from India and China catch up in skill and practice to the graduate of Stanford CS. As the batallion of elite American college student prepares on one side of the battlefield to compete against the growing hordes of Asian self-learners on the other side, perhaps it would be wise of me to sneak off the battlefield entirely.

What is the smart and technically inclined child likely to teach himself as he grows up? He will not
