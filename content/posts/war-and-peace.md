## Career learned helplessness

One of the things that stuck out at me was how elites in 19th century had basically three career tracks - army, civil service, or diplomat. Consider Nikolay Rostov, son of one of the richest people in Moscow. He explains to his father:

> ‘Papa, I’ve told you already,’ said his son, ‘if you really don’t want me to go, I’ll stay. But I know I’m useless anywhere except in the army. I’m not a diplomat or a civil servant. I’m no good at hiding my feelings,’

In retrospect, it's crazy that Nikolay thinks that these are the only things worth doing in 1812.

But everything is clear in retrospect. Consider how a novel about elite families in America today might read 200 years from now. For some reason, the high status jobs that upper class families forced their kids to choose from were producing and analyzing legal documents (lawyer), performing complex medical procedures (specialized doctor), or teaching people a weird arcane subject in order that your students can do the same (professor). To a man from the future, these might seem like even more limiting and bizarre career options than the children of the 19th century Russian aristocracy faced.
