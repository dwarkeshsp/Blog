I have learned by reading great blogs. Tt is hard for me to state a price for which I would be willing to forget everything that I have read by Scott Alexander

Peter Thiel's insight from _Zero to One_ is that competition induces mimicry and produces stagnation. The intellectual culture on Twitter and elite media provides great evidence for this theory. As more and more people compete to spread their ideas, the meaningful distinctions between those ideas has evaporated.
Even seperate from wokeness, the extent to which people are talking about the same events and ideas is astonishing. Modern intellectuals are educated by almost identical institutions, socialized by the same elite culture, and

I have tried at various times to simply sit down and write a blog post. There is nothing particularly interesting or insightful that I have to say. It is simply a deeply imitative act.

You see, I read a lot of bloggers, and I really admire them. The little boy watches Pirates of the Carribean, goes home, and pretends that him standing on the curb with a stick is really him swordfighting on the edge of the plank.

And so in an effort to emulate Scott Alexander, I end up writing embarassing first drafts which I only share with my friends, if that. But Scott Alexander would not have the reputation he has were he so easy to emulate. Then again in what other discipline would you expect yourself to even compare to the best after only a brief period of observation? After witnessing the surgeon remove an appendix, would you expect yourself to be able to perform the same procedure? I have not spent 10,000 hours even reading the best that has been written, much less attempting to produce it.

And suppose that I got really good at thinking and writing. Suppose that I could write articles which lay out an interesting issue as beautifully, honestly, and insightfully as possible. Is there any use in doing this? Almost all of the content I read ranges from mildly interesting to pure [bullshit](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/On_Bullshit).
